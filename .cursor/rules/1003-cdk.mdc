# AWS CDK Best Practices

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- These rules apply to the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) projects.
- Emphasize infrastructure-as-code discipline, strong typing, reuse, and automation.
- Ensure projects are production-ready, testable, and follow secure defaults.

## Requirements

### Project Structure
- Structure the repo to separate stacks, constructs, and utilities:
  - `bin/` → Entry points (e.g., `bin/my-app.ts`).
  - `lib/` → Reusable constructs and stacks.
  - `test/` → Unit and integration tests.
  - `cdk.json` → Define default app, context.
  - `context.json` → Store environment-specific values.

### Stack Design & Modularity
- Use constructs to encapsulate resources with a specific responsibility.
- Limit stacks to <20 resources for maintainability; otherwise, split into nested stacks or constructs.
- Abstract reusable logic into `Constructs`.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use context variables or environment settings.

### Configuration and Environments
- Avoid hardcoding account or region values in stacks.
- Use environment variables or CDK context (`cdk.json`, `context.json`).
- Support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) via configuration or context.

### Naming and Tags
- Apply consistent naming conventions for stacks and resources.
- Auto-tag all resources with application, environment, owner, and purpose.
  - Recommend centralized tagging logic via constructs or aspects.

### Dependencies
- Do not rely on resource creation order.
- Use `stack.addDependency()` or `DependsOn` only when necessary.

### Security Best Practices
- Never include secrets or credentials in code.
- Use `SecretsManager`, `SSM Parameter Store`, or GitHub Secrets.
- Use least privilege IAM policies.
- Use `cdk-nag` to enforce security linting on constructs and stacks.

### Versioning and Dependencies
- Pin CDK and library versions in `package.json`.
- Avoid mixing major CDK versions.
- Use `constructs` and `aws-cdk-lib` instead of legacy mono-packages.

### Code Quality
- Enforce linting with ESLint, Prettier, or similar tools.
- Prefer strongly typed languages (TypeScript, Java) for better tooling.
- Break long `Stack` classes into smaller constructs.
- Validate synthesizable output with `cdk synth`.

### Testing
- Write unit tests using `jest`, `pytest`, or language-native frameworks.
- Use `assertions` from CDK libraries to validate synthesized templates.
- Include integration tests that validate outputs or state post-deploy.

### CI/CD Integration
- Integrate `cdk synth`, `cdk diff`, and `cdk deploy --require-approval` in pipelines.
- Validate changes with approvals before live deployment.
- Use environment-specific pipelines with separate roles.

### Documentation
- Document purpose and usage in `README.md` for each app or module.
- Use inline comments for complex logic.
- Include diagrams (using mermaid) or usage examples where helpful.

## Critical Rules

<critical>
- NEVER store secrets or environment credentials in source.
- ALWAYS run `cdk synth` to validate generated CloudFormation.
- ALWAYS use CDK context or environment configuration for deploy-time values.
- NEVER mix CDK v1 and v2 libraries.
- ALWAYS follow the resource tagging policy (if it's undefined, seek clarification).
